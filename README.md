The .vimrc file should be stored in the home directory. Usually I only use `set number` but this file will be configured to work with python.  

This .vimrc file is based on https://realpython.com/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/  
Vundle is the used Vim extension manager. Clone it directly into the ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim directory.

Run `:PluginInstall` after downloading the .vimrc file.

Follow YouCompleteMe installation guidelines after running `:PluginInstall` within Vim.
